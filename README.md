# 🎱 Ask Me Anything (Magic 8 Ball – Flutter)

A simple Flutter application inspired by the **Magic 8 Ball**.  
Each time the user taps on the ball, a random answer image is displayed.

This project is part of my Flutter learning journey and demonstrates:
- Stateful widgets
- Random number generation
- Image assets usage
- Basic UI with Material Design
